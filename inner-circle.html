      You did not arrive here by chance.<br><br>

      In the old houses of Kemet, it was taught that only those who could recognize 
      the hidden signs were ready to begin the deeper journey.  

      To perceive the unseen is to step beyond the common path —  
      and to step beyond is to accept responsibility for sight.
      <br><br>

      This chamber marks the first threshold.  
      What is spoken here is not offered to the masses, nor carried by ordinary winds.  
      Only those who discover the hidden door may enter the corridor of higher work.
      <br><br>

      Walk with intention.  
      Read with discernment.  
      Act with sovereignty.
